# extracreditpetition



I am signing this petition as a Queer Muslim American who cares for her safety as well as her family's. I sign this petition under the motivation of reminding America that "becoming great again" has nothing to do with people rising up, but a leader to set a good example.

There are alarming videos and articles of the amount of protesters taken from Trump rallies simply because the color of their skin, whether they're protesting or not; at the same time visible KKK members haven't been taken out at all. I have people who I care about that are undocumented as well, I have people whose names are on the watch list, I have siblings younger than me that don't deserve to grow up in a world where these types of candidates are legitimized.

Freedom of speech is this petition. Inciting hate crimes through words of a powerful figure is a tyranny.

"(CNN)Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called Monday for barring all Muslims from entering the United States.

"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on," a campaign press release said.

Trump, who has previously called for surveillance against mosques and said he was open to establishing a database for all Muslims living in the U.S., made his latest controversial call in a news release. His message comes in the wake of a deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by suspected ISIS sympathizers and the day after President Barack Obama asked the country not to "turn against one another" out of fear."
